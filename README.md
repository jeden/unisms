Universal SMS Gateway

This is a project I wrote in 2009, but never finished, although it's almost complete.

It is a SMS gateway that can work ideally with any provider. New providers can be added by implementing a plug in.
Plugins are already developed for Aspsms and Clickatell, plus a fake provider used for testing purposes.

Developed in C#/.NET 2.0 and using MSSQL
